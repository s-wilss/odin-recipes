    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts </li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons Cantanzaro herbs </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter </li>
        <li> 1 shallot, minced </li>
        <li> 6 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li> 2 cups orzo pasta </li>
        <li> 2 cups chicken broth </li>
        <li> 1 3/4 cups milk </li>
        <li> 1/4 cup whipping cream </li>
        <li> 1/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes, cut into short, thin strips </li>
        <li> 1 (5.2 ounce) package BoursinÂ® Garlic and Fine Herbs Cheese </li>
        <li> 2 cups chopped spinach </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Season both sides of chicken breasts with Cantanzaro herbs and salt.</li>
        <li> Heat olive oil and butter in a deep dish cast iron skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add 
            chicken in a single layer, and cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove to a plate and keep warm.</li>
        <li> Add shallot and garlic to the same skillet. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add orzo and stir to coat with oil. </li>
        <li> Stir in chicken broth, milk, and whipping cream; stir in sun dried tomatoes. Nestle Boursin cheese wheel into the orzo 
            mixture in the center of the skillet. Add chicken back to the skillet; cover.</li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until orzo is tender with a bite and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices 
            run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li> Move chicken to the side, and add in the spinach. Stir until spinach wilts, about 1 minute. Serve immediately.</li>
