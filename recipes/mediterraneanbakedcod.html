    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p> This Mediterranean baked cod is a simple recipe for adding Mediterranean flavor to <em> flaky, healthy, baked cod </em>. Topped with a lemony mix of olives, artichokes, 
        and sun-dried tomatoes, itâ€™s quick and easy enough for the ultimate weeknight dinner, but impressive enough for guests.</p>
    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> nonstick cooking spray </li>
        <li> 1 1/2 pounds cod filets </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon olive oil </li>
        <li> 1 1/2 teaspoons Greek seasoning </li>
        <li> 1/3 cup pitted Kalamata olives </li>
        <li> 1/3 cup roughly chopped drained artichoke hearts in brine </li>
        <li> 1/4 cup julienned drained sun-dried tomatoes packed in olive oil </li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons freshly-squeezed lemon juice </li>
        <li> 3 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or as needed </li>
        <li> 4 fresh lemon wedges </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees F). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and spray with cooking spray. </li>
        <li> Pat fish filets dry with a paper towel. Place cod on the baking sheet, lightly coat the tops with olive oil, and sprinkle with Greek seasoning. </li>
        <li> In a small bowl, combine Kalamata olives, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, lemon juice, and garlic. Evenly spoon the mixture over the filets. </li>
        <li> Bake until cod flakes easily with a fork, 14 to 16 minutes. The internal temperature, measured with an instant-read thermometer, should reach 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Baking time may vary slightly depending on the thickness of filets. </li>
        <li> Carefully remove cod and topping to a serving dish using a large spatula. Garnish with chopped parsley, and serve immediately with a wedge of lemon. </li>
    </ol>
